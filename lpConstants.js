// effectively negligible, and small reports may even fall under Irys's free

// The base is GLUE, not a reserve. Its only job is to connect the discrete
// band positions so price can move between them; in a CLMM a zero-liquidity
// stretch has nothing to swap against and price teleports across it.
//
//   - If the bands leave GAPS between positions, the base must exist with
//     at least one whole token. That is a hard requirement (refused before
//     any SOL is spent). One token is enough to make the range continuous.
//   - If the bands are contiguous, no base is required at all.

// token the aggregators will happily report a price derived from a pool
// holding a few dollars — a number that reflects the last tiny trade, not
// a market. Using it puts that pool at a different market cap than its
// siblings; arbitrage then drains the cheap side the moment trading opens
// and the chart shows an immediate crash.
